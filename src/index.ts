/**
 * The composition root.
 *
 * Everything this service is made of is constructed here, once, in an order that is not
 * arbitrary. Each step below carries the reason it must precede the next.
 *
 * What this file deliberately does **not** do: run migrations. That is `src/migrator.ts`, a
 * separate one-shot process. See AD-17 and rule 7.
 *
 * Traces are exported by the OpenTelemetry SDK loaded ahead of this module —
 * `NODE_OPTIONS=--import @opentelemetry/auto-instrumentations-node/register` in the deploy. That
 * is why no `OTEL_*` variable appears in `src/env.ts`: the service does not read them, so under
 * rule 9 it must not declare them.
