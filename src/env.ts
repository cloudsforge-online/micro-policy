 * nowhere else, so the deploy manifest can be derived from it and `env_file: .env` fan-out (which
 * hands every container the whole estate's secrets) has nothing to justify it.
 *
 * Note what is deliberately absent: `OUTBOX_SIGNING_SECRET`. Policy produces no events in this
 * build — the reason is written out in `migrations.ts` — and declaring a secret a service never
 * reads is how a deployment ends up handing out credentials nothing can account for.
